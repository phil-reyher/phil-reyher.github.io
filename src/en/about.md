I created this website in order document about the projects I do and what I learn during my academic journey. This hopefully teaches me proper documentation, overall good practeices and allows me to share my knowledge (although it is still quite limited at this time) and to build a portfolio. My dream is to become a data scientist, as it combines my passion for reasearch, maths, stats and programming.

# Academic Background
I am currently in my undergrads, studying a sports and exercise science degree at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany. Here I was exposed to statistics and R Programming, leading to my current passion.

# Personal
I grew up in northern Germany and love going for walks picking heavy stuff up and putting it down and spending time with my lady. I have a notoriously bad taste in music and have always liked anything absurd...absurd jokes...art...philiosphy...Media...and so on (I don't know why it amuses me so much). Trying to live in line with Cynicism - not the stupid, pessimistic kind, think Diogenes... Behold! I brought you a human! Can't decide if I am a philantropist yet...


RIP Terry Davis
